# Submitting a new Pattern idea

* Pattern ideas can be submitted via a new [issue](https://github.com/IBM/incubator/issues/new)

Include details such as:
* A link to the source code, if it exists
* If no code exists, will the journey submitter produce the code, or a developer from the journey team?
* Apply the [pattern](https://github.com/IBM/incubator/labels/pattern) label to your issue.

Before an idea is approved, think about it from the following aspect:
* Why is the pattern is a good idea?
* What is it's advocacy potential?
* Is the pattern free to run? 
* Who will be doing the code?
* Are we inheriting code?
* What is it's priority?
* Is it for a product or release launch?
* Does this pattern fill a gap in our portfolio?
* Does it overlap with our existing portfolio?
* Can we partner up with a client?
* Does this pattern highlight an IBM product advantage vs market products

## Reviewing pull requests

A note to pattern developers: The expectation for each journey is that once the initial set of code has been checked in we expect pull-requests to be used exclusively and authors do not self merge content.
